 License
 .
 THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
 COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY
 COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
 AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
 .
 BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE
 TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY
 BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS
 CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND
 CONDITIONS.
 .
 1. Definitions
 .
 1.  "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue,
     anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in
     unmodified form, along with one or more other contributions,
     constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are
     assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a
     Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined
     below) for the purposes of this License.
 2.  "Creative Commons Compatible License" means a license that is listed
     at http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has been
     approved by Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent to this
     License, including, at a minimum, because that license: (i) contains
     terms that have the same purpose, meaning and effect as the License
     Elements of this License; and, (ii) explicitly permits the
     relicensing of derivatives of works made available under that
     license under this License or either a Creative Commons unported
     license or a Creative Commons jurisdiction license with the same
     License Elements as this License.
 3.  "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work
     and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical
     arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture
     version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment,
     condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
     transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a
     Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the
     purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work
     is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of
     the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be
     considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.
 4.  "License Elements" means the following high-level license attributes
     as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this License:
     Attribution, ShareAlike.
 5.  "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities
     that offers the Work under the terms of this License.
 6.  "Original Author" means the individual, individuals, entity or
     entities who created the Work.
 7.  "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the
     terms of this License.
 8.  "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
     License who has not previously violated the terms of this License
     with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission
     from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a
     previous violation.
 .
 2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce,
 limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other
 limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under
 copyright law or other applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
 Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
 perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
 exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
 .
 1.  to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
     Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
     Collective Works;
 2.  to create and reproduce Derivative Works provided that any such
     Derivative Work, including any translation in any medium, takes
     reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify
     that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a
     translation could be marked "The original work was translated from
     English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original
     work has been modified.";
 3.  to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
     publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio
     transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;
 4.  to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
     publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio
     transmission Derivative Works.
 5.  For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition:
 .
     1.  Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives
         the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or, in the
         event that Licensor is a member of a performance rights society
         (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), via that society, royalties for the
         public performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast)
         of the Work.
     2.  Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the
         exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music
         rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency),
         royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work ("cover
         version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license
         created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the
         equivalent in other jurisdictions).
 .
 6.  Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of
     doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the
     exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a
     performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the
     public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to
     the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US
     Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
 known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
 such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
 in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor
 are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
 made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
 1.  You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
     digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and
     You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for,
     this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You
     distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
     digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work
     that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of a
     recipient of the Work to exercise of the rights granted to that
     recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the
     Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License
     and to the disclaimer of warranties. When You distribute, publicly
     display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work,
     You may not impose any technological measures on the Work that
     restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise
     of the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
     License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a
     Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart
     from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this
     License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any
     Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
     Collective Work any credit as required by Section 4(c), as
     requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any
     Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
     Derivative Work any credit as required by Section 4(c), as
     requested.
 2.  You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
     digitally perform a Derivative Work only under: (i) the terms of
     this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same
     License Elements as this License; (iii) either the Creative Commons
     (Unported) license or a Creative Commons jurisdiction license
     (either this or a later license version) that contains the same
     License Elements as this License (e.g. Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0
     (Unported)); (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License. If you
     license the Derivative Work under one of the licenses mentioned in
     (iv), you must comply with the terms of that license. If you license
     the Derivative Work under the terms of any of the licenses mentioned
     in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable License"), you must comply
     with the terms of the Applicable License generally and with the
     following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the Uniform
     Resource Identifier for, the Applicable License with every copy or
     phonorecord of each Derivative Work You distribute, publicly
     display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform; (II) You
     may not offer or impose any terms on the Derivative Works that
     restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability of a
     recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that
     recipient under the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must
     keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to
     the disclaimer of warranties; and, (IV) when You distribute,
     publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform
     the Work, You may not impose any technological measures on the
     Derivative Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the
     Derivative Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that
     recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section
     4(b) applies to the Derivative Work as incorporated in a Collective
     Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the
     Derivative Work itself to be made subject to the terms of the
     Applicable License.
 3.  If You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
     digitally perform the Work (as defined in Section 1 above) or any
     Derivative Works (as defined in Section 1 above) or Collective Works
     (as defined in Section 1 above), You must, unless a request has been
     made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for
     the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are
     utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if
     applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or
     Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor
     institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution
     Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by
     other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; the title
     of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the
     Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be
     associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the
     copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and,
     consistent with Section 3(b) in the case of a Derivative Work, a
     credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g.,
     "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay
     based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by
     this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
     provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or
     Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit
     for all contributing authors of the Derivative Work or Collective
     Work appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least
     as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For
     the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this
     Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above
     and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not
     implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with,
     sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or
     Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work,
     without the separate, express prior written permission of the
     Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
 OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT OF ANY RIGHTS HELD IN THE
 LICENSED WORK BY THE LICENSOR. THE LICENSOR MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
 WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY
 OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE,
 MARKETABILITY, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
 NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR
 THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME
 JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH
 EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
 LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR
 ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
 ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS
 BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
 1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
     automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
     Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or
     Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have
     their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities
     remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6,
     7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
 2.  Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here
     is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the
     Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to
     release the Work under different license terms or to stop
     distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such
     election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
     license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms
     of this License), and this License will continue in full force and
     effect unless terminated as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
 1.  Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work (as
     defined in Section 1 above) or a Collective Work (as defined in
     Section 1 above), the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to
     the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to
     You under this License.
 2.  Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative
     Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original
     Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You
     under this License.
 3.  If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
     applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability
     of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further
     action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
     reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision
     valid and enforceable.
 4.  No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
     breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in
     writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or
     consent.
 5.  This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
     with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
     agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
     here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
     may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
     modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and
     You.
